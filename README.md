**THE ODIN PROJECT**

Project 1: **RECIPES**

This is a basic recipe website consisting of an index page which links to recipe pages.

Each recipe page is made up of ordered lists and unordered lists.

During this project I made use of basic Command Line Interface (CLI) commands to create files and directories and git commands to clone, add, commit, check status, push files to the GitHub repository and publishing my web project from my GitHub repository.
